bifrost.io
====================

JS client library to send E2E report data to a [heimdall.io](https://github.com/hubidu/e2e-reporter-backend) dashboard service for visualization.

Currently provides integrations for these UI testing frameworks:

- [CodeceptJS](https://github.com/Codeception/CodeceptJS)



## Use it in your codeceptjs project

### Install the bifrost-io client package

```bash
    npm i bifrost-io --save
```

### Add the .bifrost.js file to the root of your project and set ownerkey and dashboard host.

```js
    module.exports = {
        ownerkey: 'YOUR KEY HERE', 
        dashboardHost: 'YOUR DASHBOARD HOST NAME HERE'
    }
```

Alternatively you could provide key and host on a per run basis on the command line:

```bash
    cross-env OWNER_KEY=YOUR_KEY DASHBOARD_HOST=YOUR_HOST codeceptjs run
```

### Add the bifrost-io helper for codeceptjs to your codecept.json config file

NOTE that bifrost-io currently works ONLY with the WebDriverIO backend.

```json
  "helpers": {
    "WebDriverIO": {
      "url": "http://localhost",
      ...
    },
    "BifrostHelper": {
      "require": "bifrost-io/codeceptjs/dashboard_helper.js"
    },
    ...
  },
```

### Now just run your tests

```
    codeceptjs run
```

After the test run you should see this line in the output

```
Go here to see reports:
  http://YOUR_DASHBOARD_HOST:4000/tests?ownerkey=YOUR_KEY&project=YOUR_PROJECT&runid=H1RgPInCM
```

Just click on the link and view your reports

For a working codeceptjs example project please take a look at the [codeceptjs demo project](./examples/codeceptjs).

## Typical Use Cases

### Categorize your tests in folders

CodeceptJS lets you organize your test files in a folder hierarchy. You should use this to categorize your tests.
E. g. you could

  - Categorize by feature category
  - Categorize by application/component and then by feature category

The folder hierarchy can then be used in test reports to generate a table of contents for tests.

Since you usually do not want to include the test base folder as a category, you can remove that
by using the **cutPrefix** config parameter.

```
  BifrostHelper: {
      require: "bifrost-io/codeceptjs/dashboard_helper.js",
      cutPrefix: "/features"
    },
```

### Specify the environment when running tests

You should specify NODE_ENV when running your tests. The following environment names are
supported:

  - development - when you run tests from your development machine
  - test, integration - when you run your tests against an integration/test system
  - staging - when you run your tests against a near/pre production environment
  - production - when you run your tests against a production environment

### Run tests in mobile emulation mode

In order to run your web browser tests on a different device (using chrome emulation mode)

```
  # run on iPhone
  cross-env TEST_DEVICE="iPhone 6" codeceptjs run 

  # Run on iPad
  cross-env TEST_DEVICE="iPad Pro" codeceptjs run 

  # Run on Google Pixel 2
  cross-env TEST_DEVICE="Pixel 2" codeceptjs run 
```
